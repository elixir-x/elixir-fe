# Elixir Platform (Frontend)

Archived due to time since last touched and having transitioned to a different web framework, namely React. I am still very satisfied with the hign quality work I produced during the lifetime
of this project. Please feel free to look around.

## Installation (for local development)

### Certificates

-   install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and generate localhost certificates, put them in the root of the project.
-   rename your certificates to `cert.pem` and `cert-key.pem` respectively.
-   run `yarn dev` to start the frontend project, you're all set up!

### Build

-   Run `yarn build` to build the frontend project.
-   You are now ready to deploy for production!
